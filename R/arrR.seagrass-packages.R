#' @description
#' Seagrass sub-processes of the arrR simulation model.  The goal of arrR.seagrass 
#' is to provide all sub-processes related to the grid-based simulation environment
#' of the arrR simulation model. This includes all procceses related to seagrass growth 
#' and the water column i.e., all  sub-processes that are simulated grid-based.
