The goal of `arrR.seagrass`  is to provide all sub-processes related to the grid-based simulation environment of the `arrR` simulation model. This includes all processes related to seagrass growth and the water column i.e., all  sub-processes that are simulated grid-based.

For more information about the the `arrR` simulation model, please refer to the [website](https://allgeier-lab.github.io/arrR/) or the related publication
